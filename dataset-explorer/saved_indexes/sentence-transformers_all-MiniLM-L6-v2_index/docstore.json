In 2024, the global map of forest\ncover 2020 was improved by integrating user feedback, and new or revised\nspatial data layers.\n\nIt now better captures temporally unstocked forests, low-density\ntropical forests, and secondary tropical forests that have regrown for at\nleast five years. Additionally, the exclusion criteria have been enhanced\nto more effectively exclude trees in urban areas, mining sites, wetlands,\nareas with shifting cultivation, and tree plantations. This is achieved by\nutilizing multiple global maps of canopy height, crop area, and specific\ncrop commodity maps to more accurately distinguish forests from trees\nunder agricultural use.\n\nFor direct access and metadata, please consult the JRC\ndata catalogue ([JRC 2024](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/e554d6fb-6340-45d5-9309-332337e5bc26)).

So, if a user needs MOD16A2GF 6.1 data for the year 2023\n(or the \"current\" year in the future), they recommend using the MOD16A2 6.1\nproduct, which is generated using the daily observation with climatology\nobservation replacing for the cloudy or poor quality observations.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n* [User's Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/494/MOD16_User_Guide_V6.pdf)\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/93/MOD16_ATBD.pdf)\n\n* [General Documentation](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/filespec/MODIS/6/MOD16A2)\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69b1db29-82d8-4896-9992-92ec4192e3d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "69b1db29-82d8-4896-9992-92ec4192e3d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "MOD16A2GF.061: Terra Net Evapotranspiration Gap-Filled 8-Day Global 500m", "id": "MODIS/061/MOD16A2GF", "description": "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD16A2GF\nVersion 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a\nyear-end gap-filled 8-day composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel\nresolution.

(2021), which is based on the original algorithms\ndeveloped by Bastiaanssen et al. (1998). The OpenET geeSEBAL implementation\nuses land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat Collection 2, in\naddition to NLDAS and gridMET datasets as instantaneous and daily\nmeteorological inputs, respectively. The automated statistical algorithm\nto select the hot and cold endmembers is based on a simplified version of\nthe Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme Conditions (CIMEC)\nalgorithm proposed by Allen et al. (2013), where quantiles of LST and the\nnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values are used to select\nendmember candidates in the Landsat domain area. The cold and wet endmember\ncandidates are selected in well vegetated areas, while the hot and dry\nendmember candidates are selected in the least vegetated cropland areas.\nBased on the selected endmembers, geeSEBAL assumes that in the cold and\nwet endmember all available energy is converted to latent heat (with high\nrates of transpiration), while in the hot and dry endmember all available\nenergy is converted to sensible heat. Finally, estimates of daily\nevapotranspiration are upscaled from instantaneous estimates based on the\nevaporative fraction, assuming it is constant during the daytime without\nsignificant changes in soil moisture and advection. Based on the results\nfrom the OpenET Accuracy Assessment and Intercomparison study, the OpenET\ngeeSEBAL algorithm was modified as follows: (i) the simplified version of\nCIMEC was improved by using additional filters to select the endmembers,\nincluding the use of the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and filters for\nNDVI, LST and albedo; (ii) corrections to LST for endmembers based on\nantecedent precipitation; (iii) definition of NLDAS wind speed thresholds\nto reduce model instability during the atmospheric correction; and, (iv)\nimprovements to estimate daily net radiation, using FAO-56 as reference\n(Allen et al., 1998). Overall, geeSEBAL performance is dependent on\ntopographic, climate, and meteorological conditions, with higher\nsensitivity and uncertainty related to hot and cold endmember selections\nfor the CIMEC automated calibration, and lower sensitivity and uncertainty\nrelated to meteorological inputs (Laipelt et al., 2021 and Kayser\net al., 2022).

(2021), which is based on the original algorithms\ndeveloped by Bastiaanssen et al. (1998). The OpenET geeSEBAL implementation\nuses land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat Collection 2, in\naddition to NLDAS and gridMET datasets as instantaneous and daily\nmeteorological inputs, respectively. The automated statistical algorithm\nto select the hot and cold endmembers is based on a simplified version of\nthe Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme Conditions (CIMEC)\nalgorithm proposed by Allen et al. (2013), where quantiles of LST and the\nnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values are used to select\nendmember candidates in the Landsat domain area. The cold and wet endmember\ncandidates are selected in well vegetated areas, while the hot and dry\nendmember candidates are selected in the least vegetated cropland areas.\nBased on the selected endmembers, geeSEBAL assumes that in the cold and\nwet endmember all available energy is converted to latent heat (with high\nrates of transpiration), while in the hot and dry endmember all available\nenergy is converted to sensible heat. Finally, estimates of daily\nevapotranspiration are upscaled from instantaneous estimates based on the\nevaporative fraction, assuming it is constant during the daytime without\nsignificant changes in soil moisture and advection. Based on the results\nfrom the OpenET Accuracy Assessment and Intercomparison study, the OpenET\ngeeSEBAL algorithm was modified as follows: (i) the simplified version of\nCIMEC was improved by using additional filters to select the endmembers,\nincluding the use of the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and filters for\nNDVI, LST and albedo; (ii) corrections to LST for endmembers based on\nantecedent precipitation; (iii) definition of NLDAS wind speed thresholds\nto reduce model instability during the atmospheric correction; and, (iv)\nimprovements to estimate daily net radiation, using FAO-56 as reference\n(Allen et al., 1998).

Vegetation and wildland fuels data from LANDFIRE 2020\n(version 2.2.0) were used as input to two different but related geospatial\nfire simulation systems. Annual burn probability was produced with the USFS\ngeospatial fire simulator (FSim) at a relatively coarse cell size of 270\nmeters (m).

This includes all fires 1000\nacres or greater in the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the\neastern Unites States.

The collaboration is facilitated by\nthe Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization\ncreated by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North\nAmerican Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental\ncollaboration between the three countries.\n\nThe general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a\nharmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high\naccuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North\nAmerican scale and which meets each country's specific requirements.\n\nThis 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover\ninformation for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous\nUnited States and 2021 over Alaska.  Each country developed its own\nclassification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an\ninput layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land\ncover products; see specific sections on data generation below.\n\nThe main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection\n2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and\nMexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands\nvaried among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements.  While\nCanada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and\n2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while\nAlaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The\nland cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between\n2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.\n\nIn order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North\nAmerica, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by\nCONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS.

The collaboration is facilitated by\nthe Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization\ncreated by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North\nAmerican Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental\ncollaboration between the three countries.\n\nThe general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a\nharmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high\naccuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North\nAmerican scale and which meets each country's specific requirements.\n\nThis 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover\ninformation for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous\nUnited States and 2021 over Alaska.  Each country developed its own\nclassification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an\ninput layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land\ncover products; see specific sections on data generation below.\n\nThe main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection\n2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and\nMexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands\nvaried among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements.  While\nCanada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and\n2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while\nAlaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The\nland cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between\n2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.\n\nIn order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North\nAmerica, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by\nCONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each\ncountry chose their own approaches, ancillary data, and land cover mapping\nmethodologies to create national datasets.

It includes modeled TCC, standard error (SE), and \nNational Land Cover Database's (NLCD) TCC data for each year. TCC data produced by the the United States Department \nof Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS) are included in the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium \nthat is part of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) project managed by the United States (US) Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nThe Science TCC product and NLCD TCC are remote sensing-based map output produced by the USFS. The objecive of TCC Science \nand NLCD TCC are to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology and advancements in TCC mapping to produce a \n\"best available\" map of TCC across the Conterminous United States (CONUS) and southeast Alaska, Hawaii and \nPuerto Rico-US Virgin Islands (OCONUS).\n\nModel outputs include Science TCC, Science SE and NLCD TCC. Science TCC and SE include data from 2008 through 2021. \nNLCD TCC include data from 2011 through 2021, with data fully masked in 2008, 2009 and 2010. \n\n*Science TCC is the raw direct model outputs.\n\n*Science SE is the model standard deviation of the predicted values from all regression trees. \n\n*The NLCD TCC product undergoes further post processing applied to the annual Science TCC images, \nwhich includes several masking (water and non-tree agriculture), filtering, and minimum-mapping unit (MMU) routines, \nas well as processes that reduce interannual noise and return longer duration trends.  \n\nEach image includes a data mask band that has three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped tree canopy cover(1), \nand non-processing area (2). The non-processing areas are pixels in the study area with no cloud or cloud shadow-free data. No data\nand non-processing area pixels are masked in TCC and SE images.\n\nDue to CONUS size and wide variety of ecotones, CONUS modeling was broken up into 54 480x480 km tiles. For each tile, \na unique random forest model was built using 2011 fitted LandTrendr, 2011 CDL, and terrain data. All reference data \nthat were part of the 70% available for model calibration that intersected tiles within a 5x5 window around the center \ntile were used to train the random forest model. That model was then applied to the center tile. For OCONUS, one model \nwas applied to each study area, and no tiles were used. \n\nPredictor layers for the TCC model include outputs from the LandTrendr and terrain information. These\ncomponents are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017).\n\nTo produce annual composites for LandTrendr, USGS Collection 2 Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A, \n2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data were used. The cFmask cloud masking algorithm \n(Foga et al., 2017), which is an implementation of Fmask 2.0 (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) \n(Landsat-only), cloudScore (Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), and s2cloudless\n(Sentinel-Hub, 2021) (Sentinel 2-only) are used to mask clouds, while TDOM\n(Chastain et al., 2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel\n2). For LandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud\nand cloud shadow-free values from each year into a single composite.\n\nThe composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr\n(Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).\n\nThe raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences,\nsegment duration, change magnitude, and slope, along with elevation, slope, sine of \naspect, and cosine of aspect from the 10 m USGS 3D.
